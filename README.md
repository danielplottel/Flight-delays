# Flight-delays
Data analysis of flight delays and cancellations in the USA in 2015

The flight-delays prediction dataset has become one popular dataset used by the aviation
industry to predict the delay given the historical flight data. Learning from data can be
beneficial for the companies, e.g. aviation industry, so that they can minimize the delay to
improve customer satisfaction. The insight of the data can be obtained by conducting some
steps, including pre-processing, visualization, and data modelling.

Information on Dataset
The flight-delays and cancellation data was collected and published by the U.S. Department
of Transportationâ€™s (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This data records the flights
operated by large air carriers and tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights. This
data summarises various flight information such as the number of on-time, delayed, cancelled,
